</h4>

The Threat Hunting Toolkit (<span title="Think Happy Thoughts  (âŒ’â€¿âŒ’)">THT</span>) is a Swiss Army knife for threat hunting, log processing, and security-focused data science. It incorporates many CLI tools into one place for ease of deployment and includes wrappers and convenience features for ease of use. It comes packaged as a Docker image that can be deployed with a single command. Spend less time struggling with installation, configuration, or environment differences, and more on filtering, slicing, and data stacking.

## Features

ðŸ§° **Easy to Install**

- Small - Keep download size under 300 MB.
- Portable - Works across a variety of systems thanks to Docker.

ðŸ“– **Fast to Learn**

- Consistent - Get the same configuration on every system, which means a familiar environment everywhere.
- Format Agnostic - Avoid swapping between similar tools with annoying syntax variations for different formats including Zeek, CSV, TSV, and JSON.
- Remove Boilerplate - Remove the boilerplate for common use cases with the included scripts, functions, and aliases.
- Documented - There are [cheatsheets][cheat-url] and [documentation][docs-url] available to get started right away.

ðŸš€ **Fast to Run**

- Optimized - Everything is benchmarked to find the fastest methods when there are several options.
- Parallel - Many of the components take advantage of multiple CPU cores to process data in parallel.

## Usage

The recommended method is to use the `tht` wrapper script included in the repo.

**Install**
```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/tht https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethack/tht/main/tht && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tht
```

**Run**
```bash
tht
```

**Update**
```bash
tht update
```

<details>
<summary>You can also start THT with a docker command.</summary>

**From DockerHub**
```bash
docker run \
    --rm -it \
    -h $(hostname) \
    --init \
    --pid host \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime \
    -v /:/host \
    -w "/host/$(pwd)" \
    ethack/tht
```

**From GitHub Container Registry**
```bash
docker run \
    --rm -it \
    -h $(hostname) \
    --init \
    --pid host \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime \
    -v /:/host \
    -w "/host/$(pwd)" \
    ghcr.io/ethack/tht
```

</details>

However, you will lose all the convenience features the `tht` wrapper script provides.

If you'd like to build the image or documentation manually, see [here](https://ethack.github.io/tht/development/).

## Documentation

For the current documentation, see [here](https://ethack.github.io/tht/).

These pages are good place to get the lay of the land:
- [List of tools included in THT](https://ethack.github.io/tht/#/reference/)
- [Cheatsheets covering common cases](https://ethack.github.io/tht/#/cheatsheets/)
  - You can also access these from inside THT by running `cheat` or by pressing the `ctrl-g` keyboard shortcut.
  - You'll get a random tip from these cheatsheets every time you start THT.
