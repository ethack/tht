Tutorials are currently structured as a set of challenges to encourage you to learn by doing, but provide hints if you get stuck.

You'll see a challenge followed by a section containing tabs. The first tab (:warning: No spoilers) is always innocuous and is meant to prevent any spoilers.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **:warning: No spoilers**

You can view _hints_ :question: with relevant background and direction and **solutions** :exclamation: where a command is given by selecting a tab.

#### **:question: _Hint_**

This is a hint. It usually contains a pointer in the right direction or some relevant background information without giving too much away.

#### **:exclamation: __Solution__**

This is a solution to at least part of the challenge and provides a command for you to run.
