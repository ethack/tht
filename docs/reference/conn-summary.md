Outputs a summary of connections given an input of Zeek logs. Great for getting an overview of a subset of logs.

Zeek's `conn-summary.log` file contains useful information about a network as a whole.

There's a lot to unpack here. Each colum shows the top pieces of information, broken out by percentage of connections. For instance:

```txt
Ports        
53     66.0% 
443    29.5% 
80      4.5% 
```

This means that 66.0% of the connections were to port 53, 29.5% were to port 443, and the remaining 4.5% were to port 80. Note that this doesn't specify TCP or UDP. However, the second-to-last column shows that protocol 17 (UDP) was 66.0% of the connections. This happens to match up with the percentage for port 53 so we know that UDP/53 was used.

```txt
Protocols 
17  66.0% 
6   34.0% 
```

Similarly, the following columns break down the percentage of connections by both source and destination IP addresses.

```txt
Sources                   | Destinations              
10.55.200.10#1      39.0% | 172.16.200.11#2     18.0%

10.55.100.103#5      6.0% | 205.251.196.95#6     2.0% 
10.55.100.100#7      5.0% | 172.217.4.70#8       2.0%

10.55.100.110#11     4.0% | 204.74.101.1#12      1.5% 
192.168.88.2#13      3.5% | 172.217.4.78#14      1.5% 
10.55.100.104#15     3.5% | 104.156.80.32#16     1.5% 
10.55.100.108#17     3.0% | 65.153.18.198#18     1.5% 
10.55.100.106#19     2.5% | 65.153.18.197#20     1.5% 
```

The `conn-summary.log` file is generated by the [`trace-summary`](https://github.com/zeek/trace-summary) script. You can also run this script manually and access different options. The script has the ability to generate summaries from either live network data or from Zeek TSV or JSON-formatted `conn.log` files.

THT has a `conn-summary` script that is useful for generating summaries on the fly for many common use cases.  It lets you pipe conn logs into the script. This means you can generate summaries based only on hosts or timeframes you care about.

```bash
filter 192.168.88.2 165.227.88.15 | conn-summary
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above example uses the `[[filter]]` script to only show connections between two specific IP addresses.

`conn-summary` uses `trace-summary` under the hood, and the output is similar to what we saw above with the following differences:
- Internal to internal traffic is not included. That is, any connections between RFC1918 IP address ranges are excluded.
- Unlike the Zeek `conn-summary.log` the data is not sampled by default. This means the statistics presented include all the connections instead of a sample size.
- The percentages are output twice: once for connections and once for bytes. That means you can see both where the majority of connections went in the top table and where the majority of the data transferred went in the bottom table.
- The Zeek `conn-summary.log` includes a bunch of other breakdowns based on different IP address ranges that are not included in the output here.

<!-- 
TODO:
Expand on use cases.
Investigate more trace-summary options:
--external - filter out internal to internal traffic (this by default)
--exclude-nets
--intervals - not sure what this would do
--ports - filter out extraneous noise
--resolve-host-names - Does on the fly PTR requests. 
--tcp - could filter out UDP noise
--udp
--min-time - would be useful for incidents
--max-time

Switch this around so it just explains the script output and notes the relation to trace-summary afterwards.
Don't make trace-summary the first focus.
