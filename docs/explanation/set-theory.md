# Set Theory

Diagrams do a fantastic job illustrating these concepts if you need an introduction or refresher.

## Union $(A \cup B)$

> The set of elements that appear in either set. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory))

## Intersection $(A \cap B)$

> The set of elements that appear in both sets. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory))

## Difference $(A \setminus B)$

> The set of elements in the second set but not in the first set. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement)

> [!NOTE]
> Also known as the _relative complement_.

## Symmetric Difference $(A \triangle B)$

> The set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference)
