- [Cheatsheets](cheatsheets/) - This section replaces "how-to guides" and is meant for experienced users who are looking for instructions on a specific task.
- [Reference](reference/) - This is where you can see what tools make up THT or learn more about a particular tool.
- [Explanation](explanation/) - This is where you will find deeper explanations of trickier topics.
